            <h2 class="sub-title">Step by Step</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Tip the bread mix into a bowl and stir in the dried herbs. Add the oil then gradually add about 300ml warm water to make the dough.
                    Knead on a lightly floured surface for 5-7 minutes until smooth. Place in an oiled bowl, cover, and leave to rise for 1 hour or until doubled in size.
                </li>
                </br>
                <li>
                    Knock the dough back in the bowl, then tip out onto a floured surface and roll out to a rectangle about 20 x 30cm. Spread the pasta sauce over the dough,
                        leaving a narrow border all around the edge. Mix the mozzarella and Parmesan together and scatter about two-thirdsof the cheese all over the dough.
                        Next scatter on the roasted peppers then finally arrange the pepperoni slices on top.
                </li>
                </br>
                <li>
                    Roll up from one of the short sides, like a Swiss roll, and pinch the seam closed. Cut into 8 thick slices and arrange cut-side up in a
                    lined baking tin (about 20 x 30cm), quite close together but not touching. Cover and leave to prove for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 200Â°C,
                    fan 180C, gas 6.
                </li>
                </br>
                <li>
                    Uncover the pizza rolls once they have proved and bake for 15 minutes initially. Scatter the rest of the cheese over the top and bake for a 
                    further 15 minutes or until golden and cooked through. Leave to cool for at least 15-20 minutes before serving. Best warm, but also good at room
                    temperature for a picnic.
